        <h2>Vehicles</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of different vehicles in squad. Every single faction has unique vehicles which would make this list very long, but all vehicles can be classed into 4 categories</p>

                    <h3>Transport</h3>
                    <p>Most of these vehicles are used for transporting supplies and troops. They are very fragile and almost never have any weaponry to defend themselfs. Most common example of a transport vehicle is the <abbr title="Logistics Vehicle">LOGI</abbr> (logistics vehicle)</p>

                    <h3><abbr title="Armored Personnel Carrier">APC</abbr></h3>
                    <p><abbr title="Armored Personnel Carrier">APC</abbr> stands for Armored Personnel Carrier. This is a more protected way to transport personal. Most <abbr title="Armored Personnel Carrier">APC</abbr>'s have light weaponry and are decently armored. Best example of an <abbr title="Armored Personnel Carrier">APC</abbr> is the russian BTR-82A</p>

                    <h3><abbr title="Infantry Fighting Vehicle">IFV</abbr></h3>
                    <p>This stands for Infantry Fighting Vehicle. This is pretty heavily armored and wont be taken out but a rocket or 2. Vehicles in its class have a large arsenal of weaponry that can contain <abbr title="Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided">TOW</abbr> missles, large 30>+mm canons capable of destroying any vehicle and 50-<abbr title="Caliber">cal</abbr> machine guns. My favorite example of an <abbr title="Infantry Fighting Vehicle">IFV</abbr> is the British FV520 <abbr title="The Case Telescoped Armament System">CTAS</abbr> "Warrior"</p>

                    <h3><abbr title="Main Battle Tank">MBT</abbr></h3>
                    <p>Last but not least we have the Main Battle Tanks. These stand at the top of any match in terms of firepower. They have a big main 105mm canon with up to 5 differant type of round raging from <abbr title="Armor-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, Discarding">SABOT</abbr> (anti tank) to Fragmentation round againts infantry. You will need multiple well placed rockets to take one of these down. Most well known tank of all is the American M1A2 Abrams</p>
