                    <p>The type of poeple that play this game are mostly intressted in fast range of posibility's to play this game, either you want to be playing as a tankcrew all game or as a tranport helicopter pilot that provides supplies for the rest of the team. Each match can be played in a way which ever floats your boat, which is what makes this game accesible for a large number of poeple. However it is not as fast paced as most other first persoon shooters like Call of Duty or <abbr title="Counter Strike Global Offensive">CS:GO</abbr> which might be a turn of for some poeple</p>

                    <h3><abbr title="Advance And Secure">AAS</abbr></h3>
                    <p>In <abbr title="Advance And Secure">AAS</abbr>  (Advance And Secure) both teams know at the start of the match which locations on the map will be points to capture. When you have 1 more point then the other team, the tickets of the other team start depleting at a slow rate; the more points you have captured, the faster the tickets go down to zero and as a result ending the game. The amount of time each match takes is around 40 minutes</p>

                    <h3><abbr title="Random Advance And Secure">RAAS</abbr></h3>
                    <p><abbr title="Random Advance And Secure">RAAS</abbr> (Random Advance And Secure) is very similair to <abbr title="Advance And Secure">AAS</abbr>, but the big difference is that neither team knows what point are going to need to be captured at the start of the game. So when 1 point is captured, the next point is reveiled. What this does is make it so teams can't rush to the middle point and already put up defenses. Even though <abbr title="Random Advance And Secure">RAAS</abbr> is random, teams still try to predict what landmarks will be the middle point, making this gamemode a big guessing game at the start. The amount of time each match takes is similair to <abbr title="Advance And Secure">AAS</abbr> as its around 40 minutes</p>

                    <h3>Invasion</h3>
                    <p>In this gamemode there is 1 defending team and 1 invading (attacking). The defending team gets extra time before the game starts to setup defenses and make strategies. Once they lose a point they can't capture it back making this gamemode less of a "tug of war". Tickets for the defending team are also way higher then the attacking team as the defending team has no way to gain additional tickets by capturing points. the attacking team still gains tickets as they capture points. The game time for this gamemode varies a lot. If an attacking team fails to capture the first point a game can take ~20 min. The longest a game can take is 2 hours.</p>
