                <h2>Main strats of the game</h2>
                <p> Most of the time the best strategies are to try to flank your enemies without them knowing where you are coming from. Sounds simple enough, but to do this you will need a lot of map and game knowledge to actually pull this off succesfully. That is why most of the time the teamleaders (squadleaders and commander) are poeple that have a lot of game knowledge. If you are not very experienced and are not confident in your game sense, you will probably not pick up any of these rolls as other experienced teamleaders will expect you to know how to handle some strategic situations. So if you are new to the game you will most likely be instructed by your squadleader to move to certain positions and shoot and engage at specific timings.</p>

                    <h3>Armor squadleader strats</h3>
                    <p>As a squadleader of an armor squad you are very importaint to the succes of your team. A single armor crew can change the tides in almost any battle and is therefore an essential part of any team. And armor squad is a small squad of almost always 3 members.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spotter</li>
                        <li>Driver</li>
                        <li>Gunner</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each member has a very specific duty.The Spotter spots enemy targets and looks for potential dangers. The Driver drives the vehicle and tries to get in good positions and angles for the shooter to hit targets. And the shooter obviously tries to kill as many enemy targets as possible. Most of the time the shooter is also the squadleader as they are the most importaint and should have the most experience.</p>

                <h3>Commander strats</h3>
                <p>The commander is a lonesome role which there is only 1 of each match per team. It is almost the exact same as the infantry squadleader, but has 1 big differance. Which is its Support calls of which there are 4.</p>

                    <li><abbr title="Unmaned Aerial Vehcile">UAV</abbr></li>
                    <li>Static Artillery Barrage / Creeping Artillery</li>
                    <li>A-10 Warthog Airstrike</li>

                <p>These support calls can pivot the outcome of any battle. The <abbr title="Unmaned Aerial Vehcile">UAV</abbr> can reveal enemy positions and inplacements. The Barrage's can destroy any <abbr title="Forward Operating Base">FOB</abbr> and vehicle in seconds and whipe out entire squads. The A-10 Warthog is an iconic American aircraft which is known for its pricise destructive power and its icon BRRRRRRRRT sound that the main cannon makes. Mostly used to take out static vehicles or implacements</p>

                <h2>Communication (Comms)</h2>
                <p>Communication is mostly self explanitory, Your squadleader tells you to go there or to get down and you just do as your told. But some terms that might be used when you first start playing this game are very confusing. For example:"I need the <abbr title="Heavy Anti Tank">HAT</abbr>'s and <abbr title="Light Anti Tank">LAT</abbr>'s to resupply of the <abbr title="Forward Operating Base">FOB</abbr> and take out that <abbr title="Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty">BMP</abbr> while I get on the <abbr title="Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided">TOW</abbr>." A lot of these words are acronyms. I'll give some of the most used examples and what they mean. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><abbr title="Heavy Anti Tank">HAT</abbr>
                        <p>Means Heavy Anti Tank, and is the Kit that has the most destructive weaponry against tanks with the Tandem round. So if your squad leader ask's for a <abbr title="Heavy Anti Tank">HAT</abbr> or Tandem, then they are reverring to the player with that kit.</p>
                        <img src="images/HAT.png" alt="Image of the Heavy Anti Tank class"><!-- Taken by myself in game -->
                    </li>
                    <li><abbr title="Light Anti Tank">LAT</abbr>
                        <p> This is the Light Anti Tank, so the player with a "normal" rocket launcher round.</p>
                        <img src="images/LAT.png" alt="Image of the Light Anti Tank class"><!-- Taken by myself in game -->
                    </li>
                    <li><abbr title="Forward Operating Base">FOB</abbr> and <abbr title="Hesco Armored Base">HAB</abbr>
                        <p>A lot of poeple confuse these 2 terms. <abbr title="Forward Operating Base">FOB</abbr> is a Forward Operating Base and is looks like a radio station like this image below. The <abbr title="Hesco Armored Base">HAB</abbr> is Hesco Armored Base, and is the spawnpoint created within the radius of a <abbr title="Forward Operating Base">FOB</abbr>.</p>

                        <p><abbr title="Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided">TOW</abbr> is the most commenly used term and this stands for Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided. And is an emplacement capable of launching a Big rocket meant for the destruction of hostile vehicles</p>
